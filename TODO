    A short report:
        Verbally describe the problem and your solution. 
        Don't copy declarations and definitions from the program - your code should be self-documenting. 
        Instead, report things that are not so self-evident from the program code. 
        These include explanations of solutions or decisions, the overall organization or dependencies, 
            and tricky problems or interesting experiences. 
        The report should clearly show that you recognized the relevant problems and found your solutions to them. 
        Report any remaining errors, shortcomings, or limitations of your implementation.

    Test drive:
         Write your own test driver to ensure the correct behaviour of the class (you may not use any existing unit testing tool).
         Remember that pre-condition checks are an essential part of well-defined library components. Also, use assertions (post-conditions) liberally. 
         These help to identify and locate problems near the place where they are born. 
         Don't depend on manually inspecting results or output, but create non-interactive self-contained tests 
         that create their own data and check the expected results. Remember that a "test failure" means a successful bug discovery.
